            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm George Theodosiou, a web developer with a strong interest in technology, particularly in PCs. My journey began at age 7 when I first started watching tutorials on PC building. This early exposure has grown into a substantial knowledge base, including assembling custom PCs and understanding various types of monitors and TVs. At 15, I am enthusiastic about applying my skills in a professional environment and continuing to learn and grow in the field of web development and technology.</p>
